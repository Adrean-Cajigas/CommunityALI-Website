BUGS FOR ALL OF YOU TO FIX BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW CSS AND HTML
1. Navigation bar on apply-for-service-OUR-TEAM, apply-for-service and success.html does not collapse for phones
2. Descriptions in Services.html and Services.js are not filled out, write a good description for each service and put it in BOTH services.html AND services.js
3. "Submit" button on both apply-for-service-OUR-TEAM and apply-for-service.html is way too big on mobile.  They both reference the same css file btw
4. success.html looks awful.  Please make it good.

THINGS NOT TO DO BECAUSE MY CODE IS BAD AND WILL BREAK IF YOU DO THEM:
1. Do not change the name of either service in services.html without me being there because it will no longer know which service is which!
